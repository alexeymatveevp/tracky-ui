#Tracky UI

Tracky UI is the web part for the server [tracky](https://github.com/davidluckystar/tracky) application

Tracky is for `time management`, `life logging` and keeping life `history of events`

I liked the original idea is from [toggl](https://www.toggl.com) - to start the timer and start tracking acrivity right away, without the necessity to fill in the details. Or you can fill the details in the beginning! Or in the middle. Or even after all.

So I decided that I need a tool like this for my own life.. but a little bit different and with more flexible options.
